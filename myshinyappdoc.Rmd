This document contains the main information for using myShinyApp.

The data set of the app is the diamond data set from the ggplot2 package. This data set contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds.

This application  can help yo to estimate the price (USD) of your diamond with a given weight (carat) based on your diamond type.

You can select the quality of the cut and the color of your diamond (D is the most valuable, J is the least)

With the slidebar you can select the weight of your diamond (with 0.1 step)

The output will be a plot with the datapoints of your selected diamonds and a linear regression model fit with your selected weight. Under the plot you can see the estimated price of your diamond.
